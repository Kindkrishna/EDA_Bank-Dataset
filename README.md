# EDA_Bank-Dataset
the process of data cleaning using a case study on ‘Bank Marketing Campaign Dataset’. Though data cleaning is often done in a somewhat haphazard manner, and it is difficult to define a ‘single structured process’, you will study data cleaning through the following steps:

##Identifying the data types

##Fixing the rows and columns

##Imputing/removing missing values

##Handling outliers

##Standardising the values

##Fixing invalid values

##Filtering the data
The bank provides financial services/products such as savings accounts, current accounts, debit cards, etc. to its customers. In order to increase its overall revenue, the bank conducts various marketing campaigns for its financial products such as credit cards, term deposits, loans, etc. These campaigns are intended for the bank’s existing customers. However, the marketing campaigns need to be cost-efficient so that the bank not only increases their overall revenues but also the total profit. You need to apply your knowledge of EDA on the given dataset to analyse the patterns and provide inferences/solutions for the future marketing campaigns.
